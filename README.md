### Objective
This work is part of my experiments with Fashion-MNIST dataset using various Machine Learning algorithms/models. The objective is to identify (predict) different fashion products from the given images using various best possible Machine Learning Models (Algorithms) and compare their results (performance measures/scores) to arrive at the best ML model. I have also experimented with ‘dimensionality reduction’ technique for this problem.

### Understanding the dataset
Fashion MNIST Training dataset consists of 60,000 images and each image has 784 features (i.e. 28×28 pixels). Each pixel is a value from 0 to 255, describing the pixel intensity. 0 for white and 255 for black.

The class labels for Fashion MNIST are:

Label﻿	Description﻿
0	T-shirt/top<br>
1	Trouser<br>
2	Pullover<br>
3	Dress<br>
4	Coat<br>
5	Sandal<br>
6	Shirt<br>
7	Sneaker<br>
8	Bag<br>
9	Ankle boot
